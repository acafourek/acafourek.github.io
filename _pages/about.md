I'm an entrepreneur, developer, product manager hybrid. I've most recently (2017) founded <a href="https://latlo.ng/" title="Lat Long: digital product development agency for science, travel and exploration">Lat Long</a>, where we build incredible products for clients in science, travel and exploration.

Previously, I was the tech co-founder of <a href="http://alumnispaces.com/" title="Alumni Spaces: platform for managing local alumni groups">Alumni Spaces</a>, a platform using highly-customized WordPress Multisite networks to manage and empower the local alumni group networks of major universities such as Missouri, Clemson, Florida State, UNC and Virginia Tech. Alumni Spaces was part of the 8th cohort of the <a href="https://www.eranyc.com/" title="Early stage fund and technology accelerator located in New York City that runs two, four month programs per year. Initial funding is $100,000.">Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator</a> in NYC.

Prior to Alumni Spaces, I was a Project/Product Manager at Ripple6 (acq. <a href="https://www.gannett.com/" title="Gannett Co., Inc">Gannett</a>, '09), joining as the 11th member of a team that grew to nearly 60 in 18 months while building white label social networks for publishing companies. I oversaw our Analytics product and full account relationship + deliverable projects for Meredith Corp, including sites for Parents Magazine, Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle.

I started my career as one of the four founding memebers of WPP's first social media strategy team at a portfolio agency called Outrider where we tried to convince major brands like Ford, Nokia and Land Rover that social media was worth taking seriously.
