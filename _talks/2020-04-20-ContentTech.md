With the general release of "Gutenberg" as the new default WordPress editing experience, the shift is clear - block editing tools are the content management platform of the next decade, enabling editors a degree of control over style and function never before available to a non-technical audience.

We'll examine how block editors change every aspect of the game from site design to content management to syndication and portability. We'll go beyond the hypothetical and examine specifically how Airstream's new editorial retail brand, Airstream Supply Company, came to life using cutting edge technologies and strategies made possible by Gutenberg and how those strategies can be applied to any content platform.
