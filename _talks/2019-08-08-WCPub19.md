An exploration of the operational and technical journey behind the creation of Airstream's new retail brand: <a href="https://airstreamsupplycompany.com/" title="Since 1931 Airstream has traveled around the world. Along the way we've learned a lot, and Airstream Supply Company is our way of sharing it all with you.">Airstream Supply Company</a>. Includes an overview of the technical architecture used to capitalize on the bleeding edge of WordPress as a semi-headless CMS using the new block editor "Gutenberg" for an enterprise eCommerce site with redis caching, Reast component libraries, server-side rendering and GraphQL.
