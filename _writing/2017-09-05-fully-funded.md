Backed by years of experience, author, speaker and volunteer advocate Stacie Hyatt outlines everything you need to know about running and funding an alumni organization. It is a well-informed and detailed guide on revenue generation, financial management, activity planning, effective promotional strategies and much more.

Throughout, she uses various data points cited to the [2017 Alumni Group Survey](/talks/CASEIV-Survey-Insights) data I presented in 2017 and a variety of my direct quotes from follow-up conversations.
