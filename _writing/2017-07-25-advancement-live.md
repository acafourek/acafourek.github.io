Alumni clubs (groups, chapters, networks, etc.) represent your alumni association's brand "in the field." They're recruiting students. They're hosting events all over the world. Perhaps they're even raising money. What makes clubs successful? What are their biggest challenges, and how can staff members best assist these passionate volunteers? In this episode of Advancement Live, Kim Brown chats with AlumniSpace's Andrew Cafourek on the findings from the 2017 Alumni Group Survey, as well as with Sonja Watkins Kelly, who's charged with alumni club management for Cornell University.
