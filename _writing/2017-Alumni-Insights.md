After leading the first national research effort to capture quantitative data about local alumni groups across the United States, I wrote this white paper report on our findings and recommendations. Our data included 398 groups in 48 states representing 91 different schools.

An earlier draft of this report was also serialized in digital format and I presented the findings of this research at a conference of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE).
